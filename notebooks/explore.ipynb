       "      <th>\"\\n\\n Roman era/Byzantine/Greek colonies/ Illyrian Albanian/edit wars/Epir plz read all my message \\n\\nIn the dark and solemn days of the wondrous lands, which would later be called the Balkans, there existed two people. \\nOne, that would later be known as the Greek people, and the other, the men that would form the nation of Albania. For centuries these two cultures would have many periods of cultural exchange and of cultural strife.\\n\\nMost of scholars and philologists alike contend that the modern Albanian language to be descended from Illyrian.(check the atlas of world in Barnes Noble,see where they put the Albanian languange)\\n\\nThe Illyrian name is understood in the Albanian interpretation of the Illyrians, \"\"Ilirët.\"\"\\n\\nThe root in \"\"Ilirët\"\" is \"\"i lir\"\" which simply means, \"\"FREE.\"\" Thus, the meaning of \"\"Ilirët\"\" is \"\"freemen\"\" and the meaning of Illyria (long before America came into existence) is \"\"land of the free.\"\" \\n\\nThe first references,that of 1285 cf.Jirecek 1901,1904,Ajeti 1977,1982,occurs not in Albania itself but in Dubrovnik(Ragusa) where a sizeable Albaniancommunity had existed for some time.In the investigation of a robbery in the house of Petro del Volcio of Belena(now Prati),a certain Matthew,son of Mark of Mançe, who appears to have been witness to the crime states:\\n\"\"Audivi unam vocem clamantem in monte in lingua Albanesca\"\" \"\" I heara a voice crying in the mountains in the Albanian languange\"\"\\nand I sure those who study Albanian history have 4 more importan references.(they should know that)\\n\\nWhat is the significance of these references? First and foremost, it is apparent that in the period 1285 to 1322 the Albanian languange was well-established on the southeastern Adriatic coast.\\n\\nThe dating of these refernces,should not however be taken as an indication that Albanian or early forms of it were not spoken in the preceding centuries.If the Albanians,tells us were rural nomads,warlike inhabitants,and if their settlements were more concentrated in the highlands than on the coast,it is quite likely that they were not taken note of, even though they may have costituted at substantial population group. \\n\\nMost historians of the Balkans believe the Albanian people are in large part descendants of the ancient Illyrians, who, like other Balkan peoples, were subdivided into tribes and clans. The name Albania is derived from the name of an Illyrian tribe called the Arbër, or Arbëresh, and later Albanoi, that lived near Durrës.Only Albanians preserve the Illyrian names ex; me my name is Taulant-Taulantët illyrians tribes, Genti,Bardhyl,Dori,Boiken,Bato etc etc so the question is How come Albanians are the only one to preserve this names and languange? and NO its not communist propaganda, my greatgrandfather's name was Bardhyl and his dads was Agroni.\\n\\nThe most known Illyrian sign is the snake or dragons rolled or twisted, that Illyrians used in their shields &amp; in their art.Dragons and snakes were worshiped by Illyrians, they still continue to exist until this day in Albanian mythology...\\n\\nGreek roots with Illyrian its a stupid argument,mixing oil with water,I never heard that Greeks claiming Illyrians.One point its true, some did mix with Greeks, I am sure not everyone was isolated on southern Illyria from the Albanian hardesh geography or imigrated towards Italy.\\nGreeks have their old history and I don't think they need Illyrians to prove that.\\nI was the one who started the Greek colonies because they show that we all have a worked together but never thought that it will end up like this, with maps to be used for nationalistic ideas,to claim lands.Epir it was and is to the Albanians,Greeks,Albanian-Greeks,Greeks-Albanian people. We need to show some respect,from those mountaints of north west of Greece (south of Albania) Pyrros, Bubullima,Boçari etc called home.\\n\\nI don't like nationalist of any kind, its 2008 people,there is thousand of books about Albanians,wake up, but to delete critical points that linked Albanians with Illyrians its wrong,shame on u people, it makes Wikipedia looks bad and it shows that some people still leave in the past.\\nAll these Roman/Byzantine/Greekcolonies articles need to be on one article,they are too long.I would suggest  to help in here,I really do think he is the only (Greek) Wikipedian that can really help and has an open mind.\\n\\nWe know that the shadow of the ancient Greece was too strong/too close for the Illyrian Albanian civilization, but at least try to understand that not everyone who dresses Levis, listens to hip-hop or writes grafitti in English ... is an American........ \"</th>\n",
